<br>
BEST faker package available for dart that generates fake data you need.
<br>

## üöÄ Before you start
**faker_x** was not created just to be a typical faker library but a library that is easy to contribute and grow.


With faker libraries there are many localizations that need to be supported while each of them share many resources which fake values can be generated from, almost all of them will have different resources that only make sense for that localization. Being easy to change, contribute & maintain was one of the top metrics of development when I started creating this package. In order to give dart language a faker library it deserves while also valuing dart developers time, faker_x uses code generation to generate its library code, tests & documents so if you wish to add new resources or fake value generators, you only need to focus on putting in the data instead of reading the source code and trying to figure it out (which you are free to do so if you wish). Please read the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to read the step by step guide on how to change or add new values and resources to faker_x.


## ü™Ñ Usage

Here are some of the values faker_x can generate. for complete details checkout Localizations.

```dart
final phoneNumber = FakerX.localized.en_us.phone.phoneNumber;
final address = FakerX.localized.en_us.address.address;
final jobTitle = FakerX.localized.en_us.job.jobTitle;
final fullName = FakerX.localized.en_us.person.fullName;
final colorHex = FakerX.localized.en_us.color.colorHex;
final sentence = FakerX.localized.en_us.lorem.sentence;
final car = FakerX.localized.en_us.vehicle.car;
final email = FakerX.localized.en_us.internet.email;
final ipv4 = FakerX.localized.en_us.internet.ipv4;
final emoji = FakerX.localized.en_us.internet.emoji;
final avatarUri = FakerX.localized.en_us.image.avatarUri;
final geoLocation = FakerX.localized.en_us.location.geoLocation;

final emailFrom = FakerX.localized.en_us.internet.emailFrom(
      firstName: 'alireza',
      lastName: 'easazade',
      provider: 'gmail.com',
    );

final image = FakerX.localized.en_us.image.image(
          width: 300,
          height: 400,
          keywords: ['pet', 'dog'],
        );    
```
