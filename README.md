No Docs yet:
Basically this is a library to generate fake data for dart language with ease.
The main reason I'm creating this library is to create a library that is very easy/fast to contribute when it 
comes to 
- add a new language support 
- add specific fake data providers for only certain locales without decreasing the maintainability of the project
- make fake data generation specific for each locale. ( eg addresses that are generated for en_US can be in different format from addresses that are generated for fa_IR, not necessarily but that feature should exist).


notes for later to be used in docs :

should run regenerate_base_classes when added a new datasoure file.
