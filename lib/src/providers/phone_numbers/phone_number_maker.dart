// create a class that simply accepts the template for the phone numbers of a country
// and creates phone numbers for that country.
// NOTE that phonenumbers are not tight to languages but countries
// so our data providers should provide data based on to arguments language-code and country code
// i think we should make this simple the user can be able to defined both codes for the data provider
// eg: user can create a dat provider that doesn't even make sense like CarsDataProvider('fa', 'US')
